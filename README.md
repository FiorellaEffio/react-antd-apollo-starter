<div align="center"><strong>ðŸš€ Bootstrap your React Ant Design App in seconds</strong></div>
<div align="center">Basic starter kit for a flexible GraphQL server for Node.js - based on best practices from the GraphQL community.</div>

## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`apollo-server v2`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server) which is based on new Apollo Server
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) (running on MySQL)
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/types.graphql) â€“ easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup

```sh
npm i -g yarn
```

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Clone the project
git clone git@github.com:inspired-solutions/react-antd-starter.git

# 2. Navigate to the new project
cd react-and-starter

# 3. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000)
yarn dev
```

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn build` generate compile files on `./dist` folder
* `yarn dev` starts server in development mode on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn test` run jest form tests (`*.test.js` or `*.spec.js` or in `__test__` directory)
